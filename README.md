Simple CHIP-8 emulator written in C, using SDL.
Create and run with:
```
make
./chip8 <path_to_chip8_rom>
```
The emulator can be sped up with `.` (period) and slowed down with `,` (comma).
Many great and free CHIP-8 ROMs can be found online, at resources such as https://github.com/kripod/chip8-roms and other repos/sites.
